// TODO: Need to (eventually) override the existing staking messages and queries, for undelegating, delegating, rewards, and redelegating, to all be going through all superfluid module.
// Want integrators to be able to use the same staking queries and messages
// Eugenâ€™s point: Only rewards message needs to be updated. Rest of messages are fine
// Queries need to be updated
// We can do this at the very end though, since it just relates to queries.
