## Production build & Automated Deployment to Github Pages

This site can be deployed to Github pages. All that needs to be done is use the git action included in the root directory under `.github/workflows/docbuild.yml`. This action will deploy the site inside a branch called gh-pages. This branch can then be configured to be served as a website in the repository settings. The git action looks like this: 

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1

      - name: Install and Build üîß # This will create version inside the 'build' folder.
        run: |
          cd docs
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy üöÄ
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.5
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          folder: docs/src/.vuepress/dist
```
