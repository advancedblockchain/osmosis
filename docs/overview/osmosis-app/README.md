Incentivized pools receive OSMO liquidity mining rewards. Rewards are distributed to bonded LP tokens in these pools that meeting the bonding length criteria.

## Bonding LP Tokens
Users can choose to bond their LP tokens after depositing liquidity. LP tokens remain bonded for a length of their time of their choosing. Bonded LP tokens are eligible for liquidity mining rewards if they meet the minimum bonding length requirement.

Click Start Earning and choose a bonding length.

When a user wants to stop bonding an LP token, they submit a transaction that begins the unbonding period. After the end of the timer, they can submit another transaction to withdraw the tokens.




## Create a New Pool

Creating pools in Osmosis is permissionless, meaning any user can create a pool with two or more supported assets.
Go to Pools > Create a Pool. Select from your wallet the assets that will comprise the pool. Choose a weight for each asset.
